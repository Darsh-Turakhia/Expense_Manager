# Expense Manager
A web site where multiple users can sign up/in to manage their expenses, add their bills and also save their goals. The users can also view their expenses using the traditional tabular method or in the form of line graphs.

Every user creation will create 3 tables namely username_bills, username_goals, username_table, wherein the first will have a total of all the bills of the users, second will have a total of all the goals of the user and the third will have a total of the expenses of the user and the date and time of entry.

Every user creation will also have a entry in the master table which will store the username, password, email, date and time of creation, salary and savings(which will be updated using the above mentioned 3 tables).
